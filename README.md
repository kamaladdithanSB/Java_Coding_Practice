# ☕ Java Coding Practice

> A structured collection of **100+ Java programs** solved by me,while learning Java from scratch — focusing on fundamentals, clarity, and consistency before moving to DSA & LeetCode.

---

## 📌 Why this repository?

I decided to **build a strong foundation in Java**.

This repository documents my journey of:
- learning Java  properly  
- understanding core programming concepts  
- practicing regularly in **VS Code**  
- organizing code for **easy revision**  
- tracking progress on **GitHub**

Instead of rushing, the goal was **clarity over speed**.

---


Each problem was written, tested, and organized locally before being pushed to GitHub.

---


This structure helps in **quick revision** and reflects topic-wise learning.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Platform:** GitHub  

All programs were written manually (no copy-paste learning).

---

## 🚀 What this repository represents

- 📈 **Consistency** – Regular practice over time  
- 🧱 **Strong fundamentals** – Syntax & logic before DSA  
- 🗂 **Clean organization** – Easy to navigate & revise  
- 📚 **Learning in public** – Progress tracked openly  

This repo is not about advanced problems —  
it’s about **building a solid base the right way**.

---

## 🔜 What’s next?

- Start solving **LeetCode** problems
- Apply Java fundamentals to **DSA**
- Improve code readability & add comments
- Continue documenting learning publicly

---

## ⭐ Final Note

This repository is a snapshot of my **learning journey**, not just code.  
I believe strong fundamentals create confident developers — and this is my step toward that.
